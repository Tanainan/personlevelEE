\usage{
run_icer_model(
  cost,

  covariates = NA,
  interaction = TRUE,
  method = "linear"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost}{result of [define_cost()]}

\item{effect}{result of [define_effect()]}

\item{covariates}{a dataframe of covariates as defined by [define_covariates()]}

\item{interaction}{TRUE, if model should consider interaction terms}

\item{method}{type of model ("linear", "hierarchical")}

\item{clustering}{clustering variable, default = NA}
}
\value{
a list containing the regression results for cost, effect, related data frames, and final icer values
}
\description{
This function will calculate an ICER based on the cost and effect regressions.
It will consider the different covariates and interaction terms from your data in the model.
